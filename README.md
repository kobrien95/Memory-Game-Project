# Music Albums Memory Game!

# ***Created by Kristian O'Brien***


Hello World! I'm so happy to share with everyone the very first project I’ve made on my own, since starting my Software Engineer journey. I’ve created a Memory Game from scratch with a little help from ***Friends and Family***, I’ll explain what I mean by that in the concept of my game. My memory game consists of matching up some of my friends and family favorite **Albums** ( I use the album covers pictures ), it’s pretty straightforward match up the album covers and you win.

# Game Concept

- Match the cards to win the game.
- At the start of the game the user gets 3 seconds to see the placement of the cards.
- If the user flips two cards, and those two cards are incorrect matches they will stay face up for 1 second.
- When the user matches all cards there would be winning message that pops up.
- If the user would like to play again, there is a play again button located at the bottom of the game, the cards will randomly shuffle and the game will restart.

# ***Resources used while making the game.***

# Things I would like to add to the game in the future ( *With some help from other music lovers* ).

- I would like anyone who is intrigued in my game to send me over some of their favorite albums.
- I would like to add a timer at the top of the screen, to add a little intensity to the game if the timer runs out and the user is still trying to match cards it be game over.
